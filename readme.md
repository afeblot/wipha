**Share your iPhoto Libraries over the internet.**

As soon as you have uploaded pictures or movies from your camera to your library, you want these pictures to be available to your friends, family or whoever. WiPhA provides a powerful, beautiful and easy to use **web interface** to your libraries as well as **automatic photocast** of all your albums. Moreover, people can easily **download a bunch of pictures** and import them in their own iPhoto library with your captions and comments (for your lucky friends also using Mac).
