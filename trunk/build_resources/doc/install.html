<a name="inst"><h2>INSTALLING</h2></a>

<p>To install WiPhA, just run the WiPhA installer application. You will be prompted for an
administrator login/password, since the installer will modify the web server configuration.
At the end of the installation, the web server will be started or restarted and the WiPhA
login page will open in your browser (bookmark the address for future easy use).</p>

<div class="note"><p>WiPhA is not a mac application. It's a web site, and thus, is installed
as a new subdirectory of your personal website directory:
<tt>/Users/&lt;user&gt;/Sites/<strong>wipha</strong></tt></p>
<p><tt>&lt;user&gt;</tt> is your short user name. See below for more information.</div>

<p> For those who don't like to give their admin password without knowing what will be
done, here is the exact list of actions requiring these privileges: </p>

<ul>
    <li> Lets Apache deal with php (not default enabled by Apple)
	    <ul>
            <li> uncomments 2 lines in <tt>/etc/httpd/httpd.conf</tt> and backups your
                 previous file </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Enables local <tt>.htaccess</tt> file to protect WiPhA from external attacks
         without modifying the general configuration
	    <ul>
            <li> adds 3 lines at the end of <tt>/etc/httpd/httpd.conf</tt> and backups
            your previous file if not already done</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p> Other permission modifications performed by the installer: </p>

<ul>
    <li> Sets WiPhA data directories so that Apache (www) can write in them (user logins,
         thumb cache)
	    <ul>
	        <li><tt> chmod 3777 data data/cache</tt> (777 + setgid + sticky)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Sets the setuid bit (with user right, not root!) on a small C program which will
         chmod o+r or o+x the required iPhoto Library files or directories. This has
         proved bo be needed for different iPhoto versions which remove these rights on
         every modification or file creation, whatever your umask is (I hate that).<br/>
         For security reason, this program can only be run by you and Apache (www).
	    <ul>
            <li><tt> chmod 4755 changeperm </tt></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<div class="warn"> Should you move this C program which corrects permissions, would it
loose it's priviledge to perform it's task. It would then be likely that new modified
photos wouldn't be accessible to WiPhA. WiPhA ensures that the proper permissions are
set and will warn you (and stop) if they're not. This issue can easily be solved:
<ul>
    <li>Open the <em>Terminal</em> program (in <tt>/Applications/Utilities</tt>)</li>
    <li>type the following command: <tt>chmod 4755 /Users/&lt;user&gt;/Sites/wipha/changeperm</tt></li>
</ul>
You can also simply re-install WiPhA which will set this again.
</div>

<a name="rec"><h2>FOR THE RECORD</h2></a>

<p>The installer does start the Web server and launches WiPhA in your browser. Would you want
however to perform these (simple) operations by yourself, here's how to do it.</p>

<a name="start"><h3>STARTING</h3></a>

<p>You will use 3 System Preference panels.</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="img/systempref.jpg" alt="System Pref Window"/>
<p>In the system preferences panel, choose the <strong>Share panel</strong> <ref>3</ref>.</p>
</div>

<div class="image">
<img src="img/share.jpg" alt="Share Pref Panel"/>
<p><strong>Share panel</strong> <ref>3</ref>: click on the personal web share item to start
the server. </p>
</div>

<a name="connect"><h3>CONNECTING TO WIPHA</h3></a>

<p> Now, you just have to know which URL to type in your browser to discover WiPhA. This
URL has the form: </p>

<p><tt><big>
http://<strong>your_IP_address</strong>/~<strong>your_short_user_name</strong>/wipha
</big></tt></p>

<div class="note">
you'll get the <strong>~</strong> character by typing <kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>n</kbd> then <kbd>space</kbd>
</div>

<div class="note">When the server is started, the <strong>Share panel</strong> <ref>3</ref>
may display an URL to access your web site. This URL uses a host name equivalent to your IP
address.</div>

<p>Anyway, if this is not displayed, you may find your IP address in the system preference
<strong>Network panel</strong> <ref>1</ref>, and your short user name in the
<strong>Accounts panel</strong> <ref>2</ref>.</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="img/network.jpg" alt="Network pref Panel"/>
<p><strong>Network panel</strong> <ref>1</ref>: find your IP address</p>
</div>

<div class="image">
<img src="img/accounts.jpg" alt="Accounts Pref Panel"/>
<p><strong>Accounts panel</strong> <ref>2</ref>: find  your short user name</p>
</div>

<p>So you have now all you need to know your URL to WiPhA. Get Safari, or your preferred
browser and go to this address to obtain the WiPhA login page.</p>
